This app was originally developed for some teachers in Canberra, Australia to use in their classroom, where they helped develop the English skills of secondary school aged students who were new to the language.

It was created when I finished university and as such is probably the worst code I've ever written. It was using an ancient version of Cocos2D and had such a spaghetti architecture that I declared it unmaintainable.

However, with iOS 11 it became incompatible with the 64-bit-only architecture, and I was receiving some emails from teachers who were no longer able to use the app in their classrooms.

This project is a Swift 4, native UIKit rewrite, that should allow updates to be made easily.
